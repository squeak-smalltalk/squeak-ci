Basic CI scripts for Squeak.

Requirements
------------

* ruby 1.9 (but 2.0 should work too)
* cmake
* gcc
* zip
* unzip
* curl

On Windows this assumes you're using [Cygwin](http://www.cygwin.com) and [pik](https://github.com/vertiginous/pik):

````shell
# Install pik
pik install ruby 1.9.3
pik use 193
````

On other OSes:

````shell
# Install RVM (or chruby, or rbenv, or...)
$ \curl -L https://get.rvm.io | bash -s stable --ruby=1.9.3
$ cd squeak-ci
$ which ruby
/home/frank/.rvm/rubies/ruby-1.9.3-p392/bin/ruby
````

After you have a Ruby installed, set up the initial environment:

````shell
$ gem install bundle # if necessary
$ bundle install
````

How do I contribute?
--------------------

Report bugs in the issue list, or on squeak-dev@lists.squeak.org. Ideally I'd like to see a pull request raised against the master branch, but if you've only got time to drop a mail or a note in the issue tracker, that's fine too.

Volunteering to run a build slave
---------------------------------

We are very happy to accept offers of build slaves! To run a build slave you'll need some additional software:

* Java (1.6 or later),
* git (1.7 or later),
* rvm

Ask on squeak-dev@lists.squeak.org, and you'll get a user account. Then
* add a new node, labelling it with either `32bit` or `64bit`, and the OS - `linux`, `windows`, `osx`, `freebsd`, and so on.
* `apt-get install openjdk-7-jdk cmake ruby1.9 zip unzip` or equivalent
* 64 bit Linux users will need to `apt-get install libc6:i386`
* `wget http://build.squeak.org/jnlpJars/slave.jar`
* `java -jar slave.jar -jnlpUrl http://build.squeak.org/computer/${SLAVENAME}/slave-agent.jnlp -jnlpCredentials username:password`

To keep your slave persistently connected, you could always write a small upstart or systemd script to run Java.

What does what?
---------------

`build_cog_vm.sh` builds the Cog VM for the local platform. It assumes that another process has dumped a copy of the latest published VM source to its directory.

`build_interpreter_vm.sh` builds an interpreter VM for the local platform from the latest published source.

`rake build` prepares a test environment.

`rake update_base_image` takes an early 4.5 alpha image and updates it from trunk. It's a minimal image. ("Minimal" is more a description of what it should be, rather than what it is.)

`rake test` does what `rake update_base_image` does, and runs the full suite of SUnit tests on it. It produces Hudson/Jenkins compatible test reports. It should run on Linux, OS X, and Windows machines. FreeBSD support will follow as soon as some issues are resolved.

`rake perf` runs the performance tests in `benchmarks.st`, to allow Hudson to measure overall performance of the 4.5 image as it evolves.

`rake release` produces a 4.5 image suitable for release, labelled `SqueakM.N-KKKK.image` in a zipfile called `Squeak4.5.zip`. In particular, it loads several well-known packages.

`resources\wallpaper.png` contains the official background for the current Squeak release.

To run the tests for a particular package (find the currently supported packages in the `package-load-tests` directory) like this: `rspec -fdoc --tag Xtreams test/package_test.rb`.

How do I upgrade the Cog VM?
----------------------------
* Open up `lib/squeak-ci/version.rb`
* Edit `COG_VERSION` with the appropriate value. You can find the year & week portions of the version from the appropriate URL: `http://www.mirandabanda.org/files/Cog/VM/VM.rNNNN/`

Additional reading
------------------

If you run into any issues, please raise an issue here. If it looks like the issue's not a build in the scripts but a problem in building the VM, please mail vm-dev@lists.squeak.org with details of your operating system and the output showing the problem.

While waiting for a reply, take a look the the [official VM guides](http://squeakvm.org/index.html) and see if you can solve the issue yourself. (If you do, please tell someone about it, either here as an issue, or in a post to the vm-dev list.)
